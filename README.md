## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is my first React app which involve many features at one place and i have learned many things from it.

Some of the major learning are:

- I have learned how i can structure my react router for multiple column layout
- I have learned how i can implement CRUD operation in React.
- I have learned how i can make my application accessible to the screen reader and keyboard users
- I have learned how i can test my app to make sure it is really navigatable through keyboard and screenreader users.
- I have learned how i can make my app responsive to any screen size and to a browser font size change.
- I have learned how i can structure my folders inside the src folder.
- I have learned how i can create modal and toast components.
- i have learned how i can implement form validation in react and so many other things.

### Continued development

For the future i will continue my react course which i am following and try to do projects which are more difficult than this and more challenging that can allow me to implement the things which i have learned from the react course.

### Useful resources

I have used youtube videoes to help me see how i can use css variables to implement dark and light mode features in react.
